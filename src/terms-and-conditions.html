        <p>
          By downloading or using the game, these terms will
          automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
          that you read them carefully before using the game. You’re
          not allowed to copy, or modify the game, any part of the game,
          or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
          to extract the source code of the game, and you also
          shouldn’t try to translate the game into other languages, or
          make derivative versions. The game itself, and all the trade
          marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
          property rights related to it, still belong to
          Bats Cave.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Inari Run game stores and processes personal data
          that you have provided to us, in order to provide
          our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
          phone and access to the game secure. We therefore recommend
          that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
          process of removing software restrictions and limitations
          imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
          could make your phone vulnerable to
          malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
          security features and it could mean that the
          Inari Run game won’t work properly or at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should be aware that there are certain things that
          Bats Cave will not take responsibility for.
          Certain functions of the game will require the game to have an
          active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
          provided by your mobile network provider, but
          Bats Cave cannot take responsibility for the
          game not working at full functionality if you don’t have
          access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
          allowance left.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re using the game outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
          should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
          mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
          may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
          for the duration of the connection while accessing the game,
          or other third party charges. In using the game, you’re
          accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
          roaming data charges if you use the game outside of your home
          territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
          roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
          which you’re using the game, please be aware that we assume
          that you have received permission from the bill payer for
          using the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the same lines, Bats Cave cannot always
          take responsibility for the way you use the game i.e. You
          need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it
          runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
          Service, Bats Cave cannot accept
          responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to Bats Cave’s responsibility for
          your use of the game, when you’re using the game, it’s
          important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
          ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
          rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
          we can make it available to you.
          Bats Cave accepts no liability for any loss,
          direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
          wholly on this functionality of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point, we may wish to update the game. The game is
          currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
          both systems (and for any additional systems we
          decide to extend the availability of the game to) may change,
          and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
          playing the game. Bats Cave does not promise that
          it will always update the game so that it is relevant to you
          and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
          installed on your device. However, you promise to always
          accept updates to the game when offered to you, We
          may also wish to stop providing the game, and may terminate
          use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
          to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
          (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
          will end; (b) you must stop using the game, and (if needed)
          delete it from your device.
        </p>
